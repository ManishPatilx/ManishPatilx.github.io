Avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood,especially falseness to yourself.
Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute. 
Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself. 

What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing it in yourself.
Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the consequence of every sort of falsehood.
Never be frightened at your own faintheartedness in attaining love.
Don't be frightened overmuch even at your evil actions.

Love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams. 
Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all. 
Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon
over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage. But
active love is labour and fortitude, and for some people too, perhaps, a
complete science. But I predict that just when you see with horror that
in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther from your goal instead
of nearer to it - at that very moment I predict that you will reach it and
behold clearly the miraculous power of the Lord who has been all the
time loving and mysteriously guiding you.

                                            from The Brothers Karamazov
