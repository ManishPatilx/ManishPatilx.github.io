Red Dead Redemption 2 

Life often comes fast and hard for you. 
It also brings choices along with it. Depending upon what choices you make, it paves the way forward.
The further alongÂ you go more difficult it becomes to turn back and course correct so to speak. 

So is the story of Aurther morgan. A gang-banging gunslinger in the late 1800s.
His story is of loyalty, a false sense of friendships, and a desperate attempt of clinging to old ways in a rapidly evolving world.
Choices he makes to escape this reality, to protect false friendships, and to fight against ever-chasing enemies slowly force him
to confront his actions.

Coming to terms with ones wrong doings with whatever intention they committed demands a lot of courage and even a greater man to take action
to correct them. when this happens it becomes a story of "REDEMPTION".
There may or may not be absolution in this story of redemption but there sure is peace and honor.
